        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello, my name is Joyce Diaz and I am a third-year education major at the University of California Riverside. I was born and raised in Boyle Heights where the vast majority of the community is made up of Hispanics. I come from a low-income family, so I did not grow up in the nicest neighborhood. There were times when all you could hear was helicopters flying overhead because they were looking for another criminal. Although I went through this my entire life, I assured myself and my loved ones that I would not stay in the area I grew up in so that I could make a better life for myself.<br><br>

        Many of my classmates stayed behind and did not continue to a college education. Studying to become a teacher was never a intention, all I knew was that I wanted to pursue a career. As my school quarters went on, I remembered how the schools back home did not have the financial support to get the best education, so that was when I put into deeper consideration how I could help communities that were just like mine. Motivation starts at the place you are most at during your adolescence, school. I realized that not many people wanted to continue their education because they never had teachers who believed in them. The teachers in my area would come in to do their jobs but were never passionate enough to help out their students. Students in these low-income communities were seen as living paycheck to paycheck after high school. That is because how many Hispanic students never had enough moral support or anyone in their family pursued a higher education and would settle where they were at.<br><br>

        I want to become a teacher so that I can help those children who never had the chance to see beyond their situation. The most important point of studentsâ€™ education starts when they are growing up. They are at their most vulnerable and are in the hands of their teachers. That is why I want to become an elementary school teacher so that I can shape these students into who they are and help them believe in themselves. I think it is so important for children to receive support in whatever they do, no matter how big or small it can be. Encouraging them and showing them compassion will help build up their self-esteem and motivate them to continue learning. I have had experience working with children because I volunteered at a church camp for a few summers. I observed how children would react when they received positive recognition for the tasks they had completed. It was amazing to see how one word or phrase of appreciation excites them and makes them want to complete more tasks and assignments. I want to be the one who positively influences these children and helps them grow into the young adults they will grow into in the future. That is what I look forward to doing once I begin my teaching career.
